I have bootstrapped two different businesses. Company A is doing very well ($100k&#x2F;mo revenue), but it started to stagnate a couple of years ago.<p>At that point we started Company B. I invested nearly $2mil and 2 years into its development and we just finished building it 2-3 months ago. It currently makes $10k&#x2F;mo and has a very solid business plan that we think will create a very viral growth engine for it.<p>We were just beginning to execute on this business plan when market changes suddenly allowed for Company A to have explosive growth. We suddenly have a vision for how we can turn Company A into a $100mil&#x2F;yr company. This falls under &quot;good problems&quot;, but as the Founder&#x2F;CEO of both I also have the very painful decision that we need to basically abandon Company B to go all in on Company A.<p>With that being said, Company B is generating money and is almost ramen profitable, has a lot of money invested in it, and I still believe in it just as much as I did before.<p>I have considered trying to sell it, but I think at this point it won&#x27;t get anywhere near its value, or what it would be able to get with even just a year of effort put into growing it.<p>So at this point, I am exploring other options, with one attractive one being to let someone else (or some other group) assume the role of CEO in return for a significant equity package (since it is bootstrapped entirely with my money, I own 100% of the company right now). That way I can personally go all in on Company A, but Company B is still left in good hands and can grow to its potential.<p>Is this even realistic and if so how would I even begin to go about doing this? I know how I&#x27;d go about selling Company B, but we are not in Silicon Valley (east coast), and I am not particularly well connected so I&#x27;m not sure who I&#x27;d even start talking to about such a possibility.<p>Basically, how do I go about finding an external CEO to run Company B or am I stuck selling it for 1&#x2F;10th of its investment?","time":1578941445,"title":"Ask HN: How to bring

I often hear two reasons:<p>- Cost<p>- Supporting data science workloads<p>However, the emergence of data warehouses that separate compute from storage, like Snowflake, BigQuery and Redshift RA3, has drastically reduced the cost advantage for data lakes. And in my experience, data science workloads are generally compute-bound, so in principal you can just execute a SQL query from your data science environment (Spark, Python) against your data warehouse---the overhead of serializing and deserializing your data an extra time should be a tiny % of your overall runtime.<p>I suspect that the reason why some data scientist prefer data lakes is cultural rather than technical---basically, they have an irrational dislike of SQL and RDBMSs. However, I haven&#x27;t done data science work myself in years, so maybe I&#x27;m just not getting it. Are there good reasons for using a data lake rather than Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift RA3?

In the United States, in order to legally enter this country you must provide identification.

For better or for worse, this means that people can exploit our internet and do damaging things anonymously, as we presume anonymous persons are innocent. I would argue that as a result many platforms are requiring you to authenticate because these platforms do not make such a presumption.

They used a femtocell (miniature cell tower) that had been exploited to allow console (command line) access. In particular, a Sprint Airave.

So then, just as with Windows PCs in the early 00s:<p>&gt; &quot;To find vulnerable vehicles you just need to scan on port 6667 from a Sprint device on the IP addresses 21.0.0.0&#x2F;8 and 25.0.0.0&#x2F;8.&quot;<p>But this isn&#x27;t limited to baseband radios of motor vehicles, right?<p>So using the same approach, adversaries could find open ports on Sprint smartphones and other devices with cellular connectivity.

Because you know, everybody can come with such an idea, and sure they want to keep it minimal and lean.<p>So I just wanted to ask a more broader community, what do you think about this?

Sorry if HN isn&#x27;t the right place for this. Posting from a throwaway account as my main account is tied to my online identity and I&#x27;d like to keep this information private for now.<p>So, I&#x27;ve been the lead software developer for a startup for quite some time now. I love my job and the people I work with, and I&#x27;m happy to see the business growing at a faster rate than ever before. As part of my job, I spend a lot of time planning and meeting with other people (department heads, B2B partners and of course members of my own team). I&#x27;m basically the company&#x27;s &quot;point person&quot; on all things tech &#x2F; software related.<p>That leads me to my current dilemma which is that I&#x27;ve decided that I can no longer ignore an issue that I&#x27;ve dealt with for as long as I can remember: gender dysphoria. I&#x27;m so exhausted. My entire life has become work because I&#x27;ve &quot;checked out&quot; in my personal life due to the pain of having to pretend to be someone I&#x27;m not. I can barely look at a mirror anymore and I&#x27;m pretty much living my life day-by-day despite being successful in my career and everyone being so &quot;proud&quot; of me. I want to live a real life and not one where I&#x27;m pretending to be someone who appears to have their life together.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m worried about what will happen with my job. I&#x27;ll definitely be &quot;stealth&quot; for quite some time but I expect there will be a point where the people I work with will find out. My coworkers are people that have been part of my life (or several years in some cases and none of them have any idea about this. I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;ll figure out what&#x27;s going on and honestly I can&#x27;t continue to avoid dealing with this myself.<p>So I guess my questions are:<p>1. Has anyone else been through this and how did you deal with it?\n2. How will my team and other managers perceive me as a lead if they find out?\n3.

How could I apply for an entry level job when I didn’t have the 2–3 years of experience the roles require?<p>There are plenty of project managers out there who have gotten started somehow. But how? I was frustrated and discouraged. It had been six months and I was turning down roles because I didn’t like them, they didn’t pay what I thought I was worthy of, or didn’t have a project management title that I felt I had worked to earn (oh my young &amp; naive expectations).<p>During an interview, I was asked about my experience.

I talked about the skills and how they would help me work with the clients. Even though I didn’t have a “project manager” title in the past, I could still mention my skills. And suddenly, it appeared to me that I had more experience than I thought.<p>Desperate to make more and start my career, I accepted the role as an operations analyst, which didn’t have any of the things I thought I wanted in a role. However, what it did have was experience doing PM-like work and it was with a company I felt I could grow for my entire career. Being an operations coordinator meant helping small self-storage facilities set up their accounts (between 20-40 at a time) based on the needs of their business and provide training and support. Other duties included reporting and account retention and intended working with other cross-functional teams.<p>Continue Reading Here:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pmcolumn.com&#x2F;how-to-start-a-project-management-career-with-zero-experience&#x2F;","time":1578963744,"title":"Show HN: How to Start a Project Management Career with Zero Experience","type":"story"},{"by":"hhs","descendants":0,"id":22040702,"score":2,"time":1578963814,"title":"A network analysis of economic history","type":"story","url":"https://voxeu.org/article/network-analysis-economic-history"},{"by":"123six","descendants":0,"id":22040703,"score":1,"time":1578963819,"title":"Tesla's stock price has tripled since June","type":"story","url":"https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/tesla-stock-has-tripled-since-june"},{"by":"mmhsieh","dead":true,"id":22040729,"kids":[22040758,22040795,22040857],"score":2,"time":1578964118,"title":"Donald Trump Is the War Crimes President","type":"story","url":"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/andrew-sullivan-donald-trump-is-the-war-crimes-president.html"},{"by":"estelaycacho","dead":true,"id":22040730,"score":1,"time":1578964121,"title":"Videos YouTube en mi cuenta","type":"story"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":1,"id":22040751,"kids":[22041100],"score":4,"time":1578964338,"title":"Microsoft CEO says encryption backdoors are a ‘terrible idea’","type":"story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21064267/microsoft-encryption-backdoor-apple-ceo-nadella-pensacola-privacy"},{"by":"grupaio","dead":true,"id":22040766,"score":1,"text":"Startups are in a constant battle with enterprises to attract and retain elite technical talents.

We welcome engineers to apply to attend: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workatastartup.com&#x2F;expo<p>For this event: founders and hiring managers of 20+ YC companies (mostly from the LA area) give quick pitches about their business, their tech stack and why an engineer might be excited to join. After the pitches, we host an open house where engineers are welcome to meet directly with the founders&#x2F;team to learn more. These events are an efficient and effective way to meet a lot of YC-vetted startups quickly, and to see what jobs are out there in case you’re looking for a new role.<p>LA’s startup ecosystem has been continuing to get stronger, and we’re excited to help engineers find great YC-vetted startups. This year’s companies cover the spectrum across software infra, AI, cannabis, health &amp; fitness and more, and include both 5-person startups and bigger ones like Standard Cognition and Reddit (much larger, but still a YC-backed company and interesting to many people!)<p>Working for a startup may not be for everybody; Justin Kan has a great post on why NOT to work at a startup: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;.
